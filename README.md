# Three.js Examples

Boilerplate for Three.js projects that doesn't use node.

## Overview

This examples cover some of the basic uses of three.js geared towards artsists interested in displaying models and creating spaces. These examples have been modified from the examples and documentation on the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) with a focus on adding more comments. These examples also place the scripts into an external JS file instead of embedding them into the HTML as is common in the Three.js examples.
