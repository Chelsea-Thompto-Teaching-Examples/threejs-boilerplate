    <h1>Art 109 Three.js Animation Example</h1>
    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is an example of a three.js scene that makes use of 2 glTF 3D models. The models are the same except that the green one was preanimated and the pink/purple one was animated manually in three.js. <br />
      <br />The preanimated model was animated in Blender and exported with the animation data. The static model was animated by changing it's scale over time in three.js.<br />
      <br />This example also makes use of the three.js FontLoader to add text in the space.
      <br />This example uses server hosted versions of the core Three.js, glTF
      Loader, Orbit Control, and Font Loader scripts. Documentation these can be viewed at:<br />

    <!--client2.js selects the div with an id of "space" and places the scene within it.-->
    <div id="space"></div>

      <br />
      To add models and textures you will need to add them to your site. In the
      case of this example, I added the model to the assests folder, the scene
      script to the "scripts" folder, and the add-on scripts (glTF loader and etc.)
      to the "src" folder.
