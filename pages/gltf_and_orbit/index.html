    <h1>Art 109 Three.js GLTF Model Loader</h1>
    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is an example of a three.js scene that makes use of a glTF 3D model.
      I chose this loader because glTF models are the preferred format for
      online 3D model display. <br />
      <br />This example uses server hosted versions of the core Three.js, glTF
      Loader and Orbit Control scripts. Documentation for loading 3D models in
      Three.js can be viewed at:<br />

    <!--client2.js selects the div with an id of "space" and places the scene within it.-->
    <div id="space"></div>

    <p>
      <br />
      To add models and textures you will need to add them to your site. In the
      case of this example, I added the model to the assests folder, the scene
      script to the "scripts" folder, and the add-on scripts (glTF loader and etc.)
      to the "src" folder.
